# ðŸŽ® Number Guessing Game (Beginner Project)

This is a simple Java console game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 30, and the user tries to guess it.  
Each attempt is counted, and the user receives feedback until they guess the correct number.

- Tracks and displays number of attempts
- Clean and simple command-line interface

- `Scanner` for user input
- Input validation with `hasNextInt()`
- `Math.random()` for number generation
